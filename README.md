# 1 - Trigger
## The trigger will be activated every time I set a contact as the primary contact. All the other contacts will receive the primary phone. I've also created a validation rule to prevent the selection of 2 primary contacts.

# 2 - Batch

## Is it possible to create a job by passing custom data for it. I had a minor issue with email delivery to the recipient; however, the code runs, and no errors are found.

# 3 - API REST

## The code works, and it is possible to obtain the temperature information for a specific city. In this case, I chose the city of Curitiba. Another point is that I had to convert the temperature from Kelvin to Fahrenheit. I also created another class (controller) to assist me in providing a framework for accessing weather-related API information.

# 4 - VISUALFORCE 

## I was able to set up the page as requested and also created an auxiliary class (controller) to help me meet the requirements. However, I'm facing an issue where the page loads automatically and removes the component, and I haven't been able to identify what's causing this type of error.
